Full-Stack Web Development:
I developed a web application with a lot of features using ReactJs for the frontend, NodeJs for the backend, and MongoDB for database management. I also made sure that users can sign in securely using email and password.

Multi-Language Code Execution and Docker Integration:
I enabled users to create and execute code in five programming languages (Java, C, C++, Python, JavaScript) within isolated Docker containers. I implemented a secure and scalable solution for code execution, ensuring user safety and system reliability.

Message Queue and Job Scheduling:
I used bullMQ as a message queue to schedule and manage asynchronous code execution jobs. I also created a reliable system for handling job queues, which enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of the application.

Real-Time Collaboration and WebSocket Integration:
I developed a real-time collaboration feature that allows multiple participants to work together simultaneously. I also implemented room creation and password protection using WebSocket communication, enhancing user interaction and experience.

Tech Stack Diversity and CI/CD Implementation:
I leveraged tanstack query for efficient data querying and mutations, which enhances the data handling capabilities. I also employed tailwindcss for responsive and visually appealing styling, ensuring a modern and user-friendly interface. Finally, I implemented Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
