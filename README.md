# Full-Stack Web Development Project

This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application built with modern technologies to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform. Below is an overview of the key features and the tech stack used.

## Features

### 1. **Frontend Development (ReactJS)**
- The user interface is developed using **ReactJS**, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.
- Secure user authentication is implemented using **email and password**.

### 2. **Backend Development (NodeJS + MongoDB)**
- The backend is built with **NodeJS** for managing server-side logic, while **MongoDB** is used for database management.
- **Express** is used to streamline the routing and middleware system.

### 3. **Multi-Language Code Execution and Docker Integration**
- Users can write and execute code in five different programming languages: **Java**, **C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**.
- Each code execution runs inside an isolated **Docker container**, ensuring security and scalability.

### 4. **Message Queue and Job Scheduling**
- **BullMQ** is used to schedule and manage asynchronous code execution jobs.
- A robust job queue system enhances application responsiveness and handles large volumes of code execution tasks efficiently.

### 5. **Real-Time Collaboration and WebSocket Integration**
- A real-time collaboration feature allows multiple participants to code together in a shared environment.
- Room creation and password protection are implemented using **WebSocket**, ensuring secure and interactive user sessions.

### 6. **Tech Stack Diversity and CI/CD Implementation**
- **Tanstack Query** is leveraged for efficient data fetching and mutation handling, improving data management throughout the app.
- **TailwindCSS** is used for responsive, mobile-first design and a modern user interface.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (**CI/CD**) is managed with **Jenkins**, ensuring smooth deployment processes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Code Execution**: Docker, BullMQ, WebSockets
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins
- **Other Tools**: Tanstack Query, Docker
